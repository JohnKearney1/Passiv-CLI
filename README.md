usage:

supports exchanges bybit inverse and binance usdt futures

add api key and secret as json file in dir `api_key_secret/{exchange}/your_user_name.json`


formatted like this: `["KEY", "SECRET"]`


make a copy of `settings/{exchange}/default.json`

rename the copy `your_user_name.json` and make desired changes

run in terminal: `python3 start_bot.py exchange your_user_name`

------------------------------------------------------------------
overview

the bot's purpose is to accumulate btc (or another coin) in bybit inverse and usdt in binance usdt futures

it is a market maker bot, making multiple post only limit orders above and below price

it listens to websocket live stream of trades, and updates its orders continuously

when there is no position, it enters either long or short depending on indicator settings

if there is a long position, it creates reentry bids below pos price, and reduce-only asks above pos price

reentry_bid_price = pos_price * (1 - grid_spacing * (1 + (position_margin / wallet_balance) * grid_coefficient))

inversely,

if there is a short position, it creates reentry asks above pos price, and reduce-only closing bids below pos price

reentry_ask_price = pos_price * (1 + grid_spacing * (1 + (position_margin / wallet_balance) * grid_coefficient))


------------------------------------------------------------------

a backtester is included

go to `backtest_configs/{config_name}.hjson` and adjust

run with 

`python3 backtest.py {config_name}`

add argument --jit to use numba's just in time compiler for faster backtesting:

`python3 backtest.py {config_name} --jit`

open backtest_notes.ipynb in jupyter notebook or jupiter-lab for plotting and analysis.

jackrabbit is a pet name given to a simple algorithm for optimizing bot's settings.

it iterates many backtests in succession, for each iteration, settings are mutated to new values within given range defined in backtest config.

if the new candidate's backtest yields higher gain than best candidate's backtest,

the superior settings becomes the parent of the next candidate.

the mutation coefficient m determines the mutation range, and is inversely proportional to k, which is a simple counter.

in other words, at first new candidates will vary wildly from the best settings, towards the end they will vary less, "fine tuning" the parameters.

see wiki for more info on backtesting

about live settings, bybit example:

{

    "balance_pct": 0.5,                   # if settings["balance_pct"] = 1.0, will use 100% of balance.
                                          # if settings["balance_pct"] = 0.35, will us 35% of balance.
    "config_name": "BTCUSD_default",      # arbitrary name given to settings.
    "cross_mode": true,                   # true for cross, false for isolated.
                                          # use isolated mode with care.  depending on settings, there is high risk of accidental liquidations.

    "entry_qty_pct": 0.005,               # percentage of balance * leverage used as initial entry qty.
                                          # the bot will calculate initial entry qty using the following formula:
                                          # initial_entry_qty = round_dn(balance_in_terms_of_contracts * leverage * abs(settings["entry_qty_pct"]), qty_step)
                                          # bybit BTCUSD example:
                                          # if "entry_qty_pct"  is set to 0.0021, last price is 37000, leverage is 50 and wallet balance is 0.001 btc,
                                          # initial_entry_qty = 0.001 * 37000 * 50 * 0.0021 == 3.885.  rounded down is 3.0 usd.

                                          # initial_entry_qty = (40 / 1100) * 33 * 0.07 == 0.084.  rounded down is 0.084 eth.
